There are plenty of note-taking apps out there, so congratulations on finding Obsidian! You may have heard that Obsidian is really hard to use, but we assure you 

There’s no silver bullet solution that works perfectly for everyone. Obsidian works best if you care about what we care about.

Do you have any of the following concerns below?

→ [I don’t want my notes to been seen by others](../Vault%20is%20just%20a%20local%20folder.md)

→ [I don’t want my notes to be inaccessible someday](../Vault%20is%20just%20a%20local%20folder.md)

→ [I have special needs that most note-taking apps might not meet](../Plugins%20make%20Obsidian%20special%20for%20you.md)

→ [Just let me get started already](../Guides/Get%20started%20with%20Obsidian.md)
