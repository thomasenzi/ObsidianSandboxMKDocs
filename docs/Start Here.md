## I’m interested in Obsidian

First of all, tell me a little bit about what's your experience with note-taking apps like?

- [I have no prior experience](Adventurer/No%20prior%20experience.md)

- [I’ve used note-taking apps like Evernote and OneNote](Adventurer/From%20standard%20note-taking.md)

- [I have used plain-text based apps](Adventurer/From%20plain-text%20note-taking.md)
