Great, that means you should already be familiar with taking notes!

But hold on a second. There’s no silver bullet solution that works perfectly for everyone. Obsidian works best if you care about what we care about.

Do you have any of the following concerns below?

→ [I don’t want my notes to been seen by others](../Vault%20is%20just%20a%20local%20folder.md)

→ [I don’t want my notes to be inaccessible someday](../Vault%20is%20just%20a%20local%20folder.md)

→ [I feel like the previous note-taking apps I used didn’t suit me well](../Plugins%20make%20Obsidian%20special%20for%20you.md)

→ [Just let me get started already](../Guides/Get%20started%20with%20Obsidian.md)
